# Changelog

## 0.6.0 - 2026-08-13

### Summary

nvMolKit 0.6.0 adds two new GPU-accelerated capabilities: Maximum Common Substructure (MCS) search and a FIRE minimizer option for MMFF and UFF force field optimization. Fused Butina clustering has been rewritten on a pure CUDA backend, making it over 10x faster and removing the Triton dependency, and Butina clustering now supports `reordering=False` and matches RDKit output exactly. Substructure search is up to 2x faster end to end with a new DFS backend. This release supports RDKit 2025.09.1 through 2026.03.5 and includes all fixes from the v0.5.1 patch release.

### Features
- GPU-accelerated Maximum Common Substructure (MCS) search via the new `nvmolkit.mcs.findMCS` API. Searches many molecule pairs in one batched call — all pairs of a molecule set, an explicit pair list, or two zipped lists — with configurable atom/bond matching, per-pair timeouts, and a CPU RDKit fallback for oversized inputs. RDKit fMCS options that are not yet supported raise informative errors ([#221](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/issues/221))
- FIRE minimizer as an alternative to BFGS for force field optimization, roughly 2x faster than BFGS for comparable accuracy. Available via `minimizerKind="FIRE"` in the MMFF and UFF optimization APIs and the `BatchedForcefield` API ([#216](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/issues/216))
- Fused Butina clustering rewritten from Python/Triton onto a CUDA backend, keeping the full clustering loop on the GPU. Up to 10x faster and removes the Triton dependency, by @Matthew-Neba ([#226](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/pull/226))
- Support for `reordering=False` in Butina clustering, matching the RDKit option, by @Matthew-Neba ([#192](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/issues/192))
- Butina clustering results now match RDKit exactly, with deterministic tie-breaking and cluster ordering, by @Matthew-Neba ([#241](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/pull/241))
- New DFS-based substructure search backend, up to 2x faster end to end, with reduced host-device transfer overhead ([#244](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/pull/244))
- Conformer RMSD can now return a square distance matrix (`output_format="square"`) for direct use with downstream clustering APIs ([a26ae9c](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/commit/a26ae9cb9600e69ea015abfa024fac0fd47397c0))
- Performance improvements to conformer RMSD kernels by @mooreneural ([ea09e2d](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/commit/ea09e2d8291c747b9ccdf4521f89637ebe2c3bb7))
- Reduced per-call launch overhead in similarity computations by @mooreneural ([ea09e2d](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/commit/ea09e2d8291c747b9ccdf4521f89637ebe2c3bb7))

### Bug Fixes
- All bug fixes from the [v0.5.1 patch release](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/releases/tag/v0.5.1), covering ETKDG conformer generation, Morgan fingerprints, fused Butina clustering, TFD, SMARTS handling, MMFF/UFF convergence, and pip packaging

- CUDA streams belonging to a different GPU are now rejected with a clear error instead of being silently accepted ([#235](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/pull/235))

### Miscellaneous
- Document fixes for common torch CUDA-backend installation issues with pip, uv, and conda ([#209](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/issues/209))
- New downloadable agent skill teaching LLM coding agents to use nvMolKit, with evals and an NVIDIA skills catalog card ([434440f](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/nvMolKit/commit/434440f))

## 0.5.0 - 2026-05-13

### Summary

nvMolKit 0.5.0 adds three new GPU-accelerated APIs: Torsion Fingerprint Deviation (TFD), pairwise conformer RMSD, and UFF force field optimization. It also introduces a `BatchedForcefield` Python API for MMFF and UFF with constraints, custom options, and multi-conformer minimization; a low-memory fused Butina clustering path that avoids the O(N²) distance matrix; a Python autotuning framework for the main APIs; and optional device-side output for ETKDG and forcefield optimization. Blackwell / L-class GPUs (including sm_103/B300) are now supported, the supported RDKit range is now 2025.03.1 through 2026.03.1, and nvMolKit is available via `pip install nvmolkit`.
