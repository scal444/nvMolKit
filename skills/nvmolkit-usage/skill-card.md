## Description: <br>
Guides an agent to write correct code against the installed nvMolKit Python API for GPU-accelerated, batched RDKit-style cheminformatics — Morgan fingerprints, Tanimoto/cosine similarity, ETKDG conformer embedding, MMFF/UFF optimization, TFD, conformer RMSD, Butina clustering, and substructure search. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA (Kevin Boyd, @scal444) <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 <br>

## Use Case: <br>
Cheminformaticians and ML engineers importing `nvmolkit.*`, debugging an nvMolKit call, deciding between nvMolKit and RDKit for a batched workflow, or wiring nvMolKit results into a torch/numpy pipeline. Out of scope: building nvMolKit from source. <br>

### Requirements/Dependencies: <br>
Requires API Key or External Credential: No <br>
Credential Type(s): None <br>

* An existing nvMolKit installation (`uv pip install --torch-backend=cu128 nvmolkit`) <br>
* CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU <br>
* Python with RDKit available for interoperation <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: The skill emits code for the agent or user to execute; incorrect API usage could produce silently wrong cheminformatics results — for example mismatched fingerprint parameters yielding similarity scores that are not comparable across runs. <br>
Mitigation: The skill documents result types and the asynchronous execution model (`AsyncGpuResult`, `Device3DResult`) explicitly, and includes a verification step to run against the install before writing real code. Users should review generated code before executing it. <br>

Risk: nvMolKit and RDKit can differ numerically for the same nominal operation (conformer generation and force-field optimization are stochastic and hardware-sensitive), so results may not reproduce bit-for-bit across backends. <br>
Mitigation: The skill covers where nvMolKit is and is not an appropriate substitute for RDKit, so users choose the backend deliberately rather than assuming equivalence. <br>

Risk: Batched GPU operations on large molecule libraries can exhaust GPU memory mid-run. <br>
Mitigation: The skill documents `HardwareOptions` configuration for batch and device control. <br>

Risk: Asynchronous result handles can be read before completion if the execution model is misunderstood, yielding empty or partial data. <br>
Mitigation: The skill's result-type documentation is explicit about when a result must be awaited or materialized. <br>

## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Code, Analysis] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown with inline Python code blocks] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [The skill produces code and guidance; it does not itself execute cheminformatics workloads. Generated code should be reviewed before execution.] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
Target agents: `claude-code`, `codex`. NVSkills-Eval has not yet been run against this skill — see Evaluation Results. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
11 functional evaluation tasks in `evals/evals.json` covering fingerprinting, similarity, conformer generation, optimization, clustering, and substructure search, plus 3 trigger-activation cases and 2 non-trigger cases in `evals/trigger_evals.json`. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Planned NVSkills-Eval dimensions: Security, Correctness, Discoverability, Effectiveness, Efficiency. <br>

## Evaluation Results: <br>
Pending. NVSkills-Eval has not been run for this skill; results and a `BENCHMARK.md` will be published when the evaluation pipeline runs. <br>

## Skill Version(s): <br>
