"""Contains GPU-accelerated molecular clustering implementations.

``aap_similarity_clustering()`` performs directed sphere-exclusion clustering
directly from RDKit molecules using approximate Atom-Atom-Path similarity. It
keeps only O(N) cluster state while constructing rooted-path descriptors on the
CPU and evaluating atom assignments on the GPU.

The standard ``butina()`` path accepts a full N x N distance matrix and
materializes its neighbor relationships. This is the right choice when you
already have a distance matrix or plan to reuse it (e.g. at multiple cutoffs),
and when N is small enough that the O(N^2) data fits comfortably in GPU memory.

``fused_butina()`` avoids materializing the distance matrix entirely.  Each
clustering round recomputes only the similarities it needs on the fly with
CUDA kernels that fuse popcount-based fingerprint similarity with the
neighbor-count and cluster-extraction steps. This trades extra compute for
drastically lower memory: usage is O(N) rather than O(N^2), making it the
better choice for large N where the full matrix would be prohibitively large.

                              shared memory. Ignored when reordering is False.
        reordering: Whether to update neighbor counts among unassigned items
