"""Contains GPU-accelerated Butina clustering implementations.

The standard ``butina()`` path precomputes a full N x N distance matrix and then
clusters from it.  This is the right choice when you already have a distance
matrix or plan to reuse it (e.g. at multiple cutoffs), and when N is small
enough that the O(N^2) matrix fits comfortably in GPU memory.

``fused_butina()`` avoids materializing the distance matrix entirely.  Each
clustering round recomputes only the similarities it needs on the fly using
Triton kernels that fuse popcount-based fingerprint similarity with the
neighbor-count and cluster-extraction steps.  This trades extra compute for
drastically lower memory: usage is O(N) rather than O(N^2), making it the
better choice for large N where the full matrix would be prohibitively large.

    """Perform Butina clustering on a distance matrix.

    The Butina algorithm is a deterministic clustering method that groups items based
    on distance thresholds. It iteratively:
    1. Finds the item with the most neighbors within the cutoff distance
    2. Forms a cluster with that item and all its neighbors
    3. Removes clustered items from consideration
    4. Repeats until all items are clustered

    Args:
        distance_matrix: Square distance matrix of shape (N, N) where N is the number
                        of items. Can be an AsyncGpuResult or torch.Tensor on GPU.
        cutoff: Distance threshold for clustering. Items are neighbors if their
                distance is less than this cutoff.
        neighborlist_max_size: Maximum size of the neighborlist used for small cluster
                              optimization. Must be 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, or 128. Larger values
                              allow parallel processing of larger clusters but use more
                              shared memory.
        return_centroids: Whether to return centroid indices for each cluster.
        stream: CUDA stream to use. If None, uses the current stream.

    Returns:
        AsyncGpuResult of shape ``(N,)`` with cluster IDs (cluster 0 is the
        largest) when ``return_centroids`` is False.  When ``return_centroids``
        is True, returns a tuple ``(clusters, centroids)`` where *centroids* is
        an AsyncGpuResult of shape ``(num_clusters,)`` containing the centroid
        index for each cluster ID.

    Note:
        The distance matrix should be symmetric and have zeros on the diagonal.
