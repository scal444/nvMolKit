"""Autotuning support utilities for nvMolKit hardware options.

This subpackage exposes the persistence helpers (:func:`load`, :func:`save`)
and shared building blocks used by tuning workflows. The optional ``optuna``
dependency is only required by callers that drive a study directly via
:mod:`nvmolkit.autotune._core`; importing this package never requires it, and
:func:`is_available` reports whether ``optuna`` is importable.
