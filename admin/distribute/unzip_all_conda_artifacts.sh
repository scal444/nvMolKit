# Unzip all .zip files in a given folder (e.g. Azure conda artifact zips).
# Handles nested zips: unzips top-level .zip files, then recursively unzips any
# .zip found inside the resulting directories (so build_artifacts/ ends up visible).
#
# Usage:
#   $0 <folder_containing_zips>
#
# Example:
#   mkdir -p ~/conda_artifacts_uploads
#   # upload *.zip files there, then:
#   ./unzip_all_conda_artifacts.sh ~/conda_artifacts_uploads
